      What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?

      From my experience of phase-0 so far, i feel very well supported and informed. The ciriculum feels well put together and organic.

      What are your impressions?

      My cohort and coaches all seem to be very motivated and kind.

      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?

      I see myself fitting in very well with the like minded and supportive people I have met so far. I can't wait to start pair programming with them, andreally looking forward to getting stuck into some long intense days at DBC in Welli.

      Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?

      I have reaslied that I am going to need to dedicate alot more time during the week to the phase-0 assignment and learning. There is not enough time to get it all done over the weekends.

    Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

      Yes I am very excited about this learning environment. I have done the whole university thing, and I eventually learned what I needed to know, but it too way too long, and I feel that the EDA way of teaching and learning will be vastly more benificial for me. 
      Yes it does make me nervous, I am worried about quitting my job and going back to full-time study. However I feel that EDA will give me the best shot at getting into a new field that I have the potential to excel at, but mist importantly, enjoy myself
